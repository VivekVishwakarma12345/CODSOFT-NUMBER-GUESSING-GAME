Explanation of the Code:

Seed the Random Number Generator:

std::srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(std::time(0)));

Seeds the random number generator with the current time to ensure different random numbers each time the program runs.
Generate a Random Number:

int randomNumber = std::rand() % 100 + 1;

Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
User Input and Feedback Loop:


while (guess != randomNumber) {
    std::cout << "Enter your guess: ";
    std::cin >> guess;
    attempts++;

    if (guess < randomNumber) {
        std::cout << "Too low! Try again." << std::endl;
    } else if (guess > randomNumber) {
        std::cout << "Too high! Try again." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number!" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "It took you " << attempts << " attempts." << std::endl;
    }
}

Continuously prompts the user to enter their guess and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number.

The number of attempts is tracked and displayed when the correct number is guessed.
Running the Program:

Compile and run the program. The user will be prompted to guess the randomly generated number between 1 and 100, receiving feedback after each guess until they guess correctly. The program will then display the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.
